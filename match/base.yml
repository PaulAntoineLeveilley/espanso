# espanso match file

# For a complete introduction, visit the official docs at: https://espanso.org/docs/

# You can use this file to define the base matches (aka snippets)
# that will be available in every application when using espanso.

# Matches are substitution rules: when you type the "trigger" string
# it gets replaced by the "replace" string.
matches:
  # Simple text replacement
  - trigger: ":espanso"
    replace: "Hi there!"

  - trigger: ":at"
    replace: "@"

  - trigger: ":dl"
    replace: "$"

  - trigger: ":pc"
    replace: "%"

  - trigger: ":br"
    replace: "Bien cordialement,\nPaul-Antoine Leveilley"

  - trigger: ":pau"
    replace: "Paul-Antoine"

  - trigger: ":pl"
    replace: "Paul-Antoine Leveilley"

  - trigger: ":lev"
    replace: "Leveilley"

  - trigger: ":xp"
    replace: "^"

  - trigger: ":axp"
    replace: "â"

  - trigger: ":exp"
    replace: "ê"

  - trigger: ":ixp"
    replace: "î"

  - trigger: ":oxp"
    replace: "ô"

  - trigger: ":uxp"
    replace: "û"

  - trigger: ":ou"
    replace: "ù"

  - trigger: ":or"
    replace: "|"

  - trigger: ":eur"
    replace: "€"

  - trigger: ":di"
    replace: "#"

  - trigger: ":btk"
    replace: "`"

  - trigger: ":uac"
    replace: "ù"
  # NOTE: espanso uses YAML to define matches, so pay attention to the indentation

  # But matches can also be dynamic:

  # Print the current date
  - trigger: ":date"
    replace: "{{mydate}}"
    vars:
      - name: mydate
        type: date
        params:
          format: "%m/%d/%Y"

  # Print the output of a shell command
  - trigger: ":shell"
    replace: "{{output}}"
    vars:
      - name: output
        type: shell
        params:
          cmd: "echo 'Hello from your shell'"
